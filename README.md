## How to use it

It is very simple! Just complete the URL in the address bar according to the following scheme:

```
<url>/?receiver=<receiver>&sender=<sender>
```

Example: 
```
https://happy-birthday.peter-stuhlmann.now.sh/?receiver=Romeo&sender=Juliet
```

You can also use spaces. These are then automatically replaced by _%20_ in url, but they are displayed correctly on the page.

Example: 
```
https://happy-birthday.peter-stuhlmann.now.sh/?receiver=Leandro&sender=Atar%20and%20Peter
```

It will look like this:
